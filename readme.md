    make your life noise free


## Motive
The motive of this project was to create an interface which will facilitate users to eliminate noise during video conferencing calls\
Our aim is to make a website/app which will take user's voice as input and process it to reduce the noise signals which are distorting speech signal and provides a noise free output.This feature can go handy with video conferencing applications and allow users to communicate in a noise free environment.
### Objectives Achieved
We are able to design a website which will take user's voice as an input and process it to reduce noise and gives us computerised output speech signal.

## Framework
To create this project, we used following modules of python programming language:
- SpeechRecognition
- Pyaudio
- Playsound
- GttS 

## Future Improvements Scope

We will need to convert class 'speech_recognition.AudioData' into a .mp3 or .wav format in order to have the output which consists of user's speech signal free of noise.
